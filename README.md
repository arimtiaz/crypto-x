# Cryptocurrency Tracker

A simple and intuitive cryptocurrency tracker built using JavaScript. This application fetches data from the [Mobula API](https://mobula.fi/) to display live cryptocurrency prices and allows users to add cryptocurrencies to a watchlist. The UI is designed using Flowbite and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Live Cryptocurrency Prices:** Fetches and displays real-time cryptocurrency data from the Mobula API.
- **Watchlist Functionality:** Allows users to add their favorite cryptocurrencies to a personalized watchlist.
- **Local Storage Support:** Saves the watchlist data locally in the browser's local storage, so users don't lose their selections when they refresh or revisit the page.
